# City-Explorer

(ver. 1.0)

## Author - Mike McCarty

This project is the second JS React app Using APIs and produces a map with longitude and latitude in a modal

## Lab 06/07

## Problem Domain

14/15/16 November - Took three days to get lab 6 done but finally accomplished.
17 November - Weather data is now functioning in a modal for each city on the front end with appropriate error handling. The map location is not functioning as it is commented out and not a requirement for lab 7 but the map data & latitude and longitude is still being called from LocationIQ.
19 November - Shifted weather data to be retrieved from Weather Bit versus using the weather.json file.
